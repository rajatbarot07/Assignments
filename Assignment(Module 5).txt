     There are 3 types of containers :-

     2.Responsive Container(along with sm, md, lg, xl, xxl)

                       Content here
                 </div>

    2. Responsive container :-  Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is wide until the specified breakpoint is reached,
                                after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. 

       Syntax :- <div class="container-sm">for small breakpoint</div>
                 <div class="container-md">for medium breakpoint</div>
                 <div class="container-lg">for large breakpoint</div>
                 <div class="container-xl">for extra large breakpoint</div>
                 <div class="container-xxl">for extra large breakpoint</div>

     3. Fluid container :-  Fluid-container uses the ‘.container-fluid’ class. It is used for a full-width container, 
                            spanning the entire width of the viewport.
 
        Syntax :- <div class="fluid-container">
